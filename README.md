## Components

### TodoForm

The `TodoForm` component allows users to input a new task.  
- **State Management**: Uses `useState` to handle task input.
- **Integration**: Calls `addTodo` from the `TodoContext` to add a task to the list.

### TodoItem

The `TodoItem` component displays individual tasks.  
- **Editable**: Allows toggling between read-only and editable states for tasks.
- **Completion Toggle**: Tasks can be marked as completed.
- **Delete**: Provides a button to remove tasks.

### TodoContext

The `TodoContext` handles the global state for todos.  
- **State**: Contains the todo list and methods for managing tasks.
- **Provider**: Wraps the app to provide global state access.

## Technologies Used
